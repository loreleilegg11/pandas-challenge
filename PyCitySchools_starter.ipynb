    "- Based on the analyis performed it is shown that the charter schools performed better overall than the District schools in average math and reading scores and student scores. The overall pass rate was 90.43 % at charter schools while on 53.67% at district schools.\n",
    "- Students in schools that had higher budgets performed worse than those attending schools with smaller budgets.\n",
    "- The small and medium size schools overall outperformed the large schools. The small and medium size schools had very similar pass rates, but the medium size schools marginally outperformed the small school in terms of % passing rates.\n",
    "- The reading and math schools remain fairly constant at each school as you can see when the average scores are taken at each grade within every school.\n",
